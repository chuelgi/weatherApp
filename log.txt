Made a good effor but now i have to make a method to convert city into 
coordinates for api to use.

im not sure why but return doesnt out put the text i had to use print
 will investigate later.

 i also need to find a way to hide credentials

 have to use source venv/Scripts/activate not sure why

 now i have to figure out how to return the lat and log, from geonames...ugh so i can plug it to
 the weather api

 can quite figure out whats happening with geopy,geocoder and geonames, so i decided to 
 just use a url to search for the info and get the lat and log from that

 managed to get geopy to work with geoname, turns out its the same as using the url
 call its just more compact. also figured out how to get the location, it just
 needs the country code instead of the whole name. for now ill just do city and country


 works ok so far just gotta allow for user input and connect to html
